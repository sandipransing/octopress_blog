Hi I'm Sandip Ransing, a ruby on rails developer in Pune (India).

I did my bachelor in Computer Engineering from PES Modern College of Engineering, Pune.

In July 2007, I started software development career in Java.
After few months passed, I heard about ruby language from my friend Haribhau Ingale and got attention towards ruby and rails and found much interesting language to learn and development.

I started learning ruby from Internet, Blogs, Ebooks.

I am really thankful to Josh Software Private Limited who gave me opportunity to learn and work in ruby on rails (ROR).

I am working with Josh Software private Limited from February 2009. Josh is one of best ruby on rails development company who follows methodologies of software development.

It's always fun for me to work in ruby on rails. I always strive to keep myself updated with latest.

Thurst of getting new is endless :) :)
