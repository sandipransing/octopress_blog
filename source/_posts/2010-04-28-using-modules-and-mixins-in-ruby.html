Before getting started with modules and mixins, lets first find out the need of module & mixins in OOP.<br/><br/> In object oriented programming languages multiple inheritance is basic paradigm (child class extends behavior of base class).<br/><br/> C++ supports multiple inheritance. Java does support  same using interfaces.<br/> In ruby language, multiple inheritance is achieved very easily using mixin  of modules & classes and that makes ruby as powerful language.<br/><br/> Ruby has classes, modules. Modules can be included inside other classes (mixins) to achieve multiple inheritance.<br/><br/> <b>Modules</b><pre class=ruby>  module Greeting     # here below is the instance method     # and that can be accessed using object of class ONLY     def hi       puts 'Guest'     end   end      </pre>Module methods can be called using scope resolution operator (::) or dot operator (.)<br/><pre class=ruby>Greeting::hi  # => undefined method `hi' for Greeting:Module (NoMethodError) </pre>It is obivous to have an error because we are calling class method and that is not present inside module.<br/><br/> <b>Mixins</b> Lets include greeting module inside person class<br/><pre class=ruby>class Person    include Greeting end </pre><pre class=ruby>person = Person.new person.hi #=> "Guest" </pre>Lets see how module methods can be defined. It can be done using either self or class_name.<br/><pre class=ruby>module Greeting   # here below is the instance method   # and that can be accessed using object of class ONLY   def hi     puts 'Guest'   end   # Below are module methods   # this methods can be invoked   # using Greeting::hi   # OR Greeting.hi   def self.hi     puts 'hi Sandip'   end   # here is one more way to declare   # module methods   def Greeting.bye     puts 'Bye Sandip!'   end end </pre>Lets invoke methods<br/><pre class=ruby>Greeting::hi #=> "hi Sandip" Greeting.bye #=> "Bye Sandip!" </pre> <b>Extending class behavior using modules</b><br/><pre class=ruby>class Person     def self.included(base)     base.extend Greeting   end end </pre> Got easy ?? Cheers!</div>
