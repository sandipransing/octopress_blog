    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>A Web service</strong> is a method of communications between two electronic devices over the World Wide Web.
It is also defined as a software system designed to support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability">interoperable</a> machine-to-machine interaction over a network.</p></blockquote>

<p>Web services communicate via either SOAP or REST messages.</p>

<h3>REST</h3>

<p>REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is a term coined by Roy Fielding in his Ph.D. dissertation
It is an architecture style for designing networked applications which typycally runs runs over HTTP.</p>

<p>REST is an architecture and not a &ldquo;standard&rdquo;. There is no w3c recommendation for REST. It is concept for better web and widely accepted.</p>

<p>RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.</p>

<p>It expects client to have knowlege of what to send and what to expect in response. It is focused on accessing named resources through a single consistent interface.</p>

<p>Highlights of REST:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is simple</li>
<li>It is lightweight and faster</li>
<li>Platform-independent</li>
<li>Language-independent</li>
<li>runs over HTTP</li>
<li>Response can be returned in &ldquo;XML/JSON&rdquo; format</li>
</ol>


<p>Like Web Services, REST offers no built-in security features, encryption, session management, QoS guarantees, etc. But also as with Web Services, these can be added by building on top of <a href="HTTP:">HTTP:</a></p>

<p>For security, username/password tokens are often used.
For encryption, REST can be used on top of HTTPS (secure sockets).</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<p>The Web is comprised of resources. A resource is any item of interest. For example, the Boeing Aircraft Corp may define a 747 resource. Clients may access that resource with this URL:</p>

<p><code>
http://www.boeing.com/aircraft/747
</code></p>

<h3>SOAP</h3>

<p>SOAP, originally defined as Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks.</p>

<p>SOAP is an XML based protocol for accessing Web Services. It is designed to handle distributed computing environments.</p>

<p>It is well defined mechanism for describing the interface e.g. WSDL+XSD, WS-Policy. As it is standardised it becomes complex t
It provides a large number of supporting standards for security, reliability, transactions.</p>

<p>Here content of the message decides what to perform and reponse (payload) must comply with SOAP schema.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>```
POST /InStock HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 299
SOAPAction: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope</a>&rdquo;
&lt;!&ndash; &ndash;>
&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;?>
&lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=&ldquo;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope</a>&rdquo;>
  &lt;soap:Header>
  &lt;/soap:Header>
  &lt;soap:Body></p>

<pre><code>&lt;m:GetStockPrice xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock"&gt;
  &lt;m:StockName&gt;IBM&lt;/m:StockName&gt;
&lt;/m:GetStockPrice&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  &lt;/soap:Body>
&lt;/soap:Envelope>
```
Here are few <strong>reasons</strong> for which you may want to use SOAP:</p>

<ol>
<li>Security<br/>
It supports SSL (just like REST). It also provides a standard implementation of data integrity and data privacy. Being &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; it&rsquo;s more secure.</li>
<li>Atomic Transaction <br/>
When ACID Transactions needed over a service</li>
<li>Reliable Messaging <br/>
It has successful/retry logic built in and provides end-to-end reliability even through SOAP intermediaries</li>
</ol>


<h4>When SOAP can be used</h4>

<p>Whenever complex or likely to change API getting developed then SOAP will be more useful.</p>
